"""
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year
that they will turn 100 years old. Note: for this exercise, the expectation is that you explicitly write out the year
(and therefore be out of date the next year). If you want to do this in a generic way, see exercise 39.

Extras:

Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message.
(Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)

"""

name = input("What is your name?\n")
age = input("What is your age?\n")
number = int(input("Please type a number here.\n"))
birthyear = 2023 - int(age)

year100 = birthyear + 100

for x in range(number):
    print(f"Hi {name} you will turn 100 in the year {year100}.")

"""
Deze opdracht was wat mij betreft erg eenvoudig aangezien het simpelweg 2023 als jaar pakt en de leeftijd eraf halen + 100 = uitkomst.
