"""The exercise comes first (with a few extras if you want the extra challenge or want to spend more time),
followed by a discussion. Enjoy!

Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.
Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

Extras:

If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num,
tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message."""



number = int(input("Please enter a number here.\n"))
if (number % 4) == 0:
    print(f"the {number} is dividable by 4.")
if number % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{number} is an even number.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is an odd number.")



number = int(input("Please enter a number here.\n"))
check = int(input("Please enter a second number here.\n"))

if number % check == 0:
    print(f"The number {number} is dividable by {check}.")
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{number} is an even number.")
    else:
        print(f"{number} is an odd number.")
elif number % 2 == 0:
    print(f"The number {number} is not divable by {check}")
    print(f"{number} is an even number.")

    print(f"{number} is an odd number.")

""" 
Dit was wel een leuke opdracht omdat ik even tijd nodig had om uit te vinden hoe ik de even getallen moest checken.
